<p>Last week I wrote about making apple pie for a crowd. This works great when I’m bringing in treats to school, know the neighbors are around to share, and for next week’s Thanksgiving holiday. Baking for just myself and the girls takes a different approach, and that’s where my small batch baking instincts kick in, hence this little tart. An apple pie just enough for two people, three if you’re in a sharing mood, anything more, and well, good luck with that.

    This Apple Pie for 2 is a scaled down recipe of that Apple Crumb Slab Pie, sans the crumb topping. Don’t let that stop you, though. It’s your pie, so feel free to add some crumb topping to it if you want.
    
    Again, I embraced cinnamon in this filling. My kiddos are divided about this. Well, if I’m being honest, Virginia is vehemently against it. It’s my fault, and an example of how we pass our food preferences onto them, sometimes unknowingly. </p>
    
    
    <p>After years of making <a href="http://www.pillsbury.com/recipes/perfect-apple-pie/1fc2b60f-0a4f-441e-ad93-8bbd00fe5334">apple pie sans cinnamon</a>, the taste of it now in apple pie seems unnatural to her. You can absolutely use the brown butter technique from this recipe, and skip the cinnamon if you prefer.</p>
